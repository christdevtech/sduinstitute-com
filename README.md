- Support for all existing variants (default, outline, ghost, link)

**2. Card Component Usage**

- `featureGrid`, `testimonials`, `pricingTable` blocks built on existing `Card` system
- Consistent card layouts using `CardHeader`, `CardContent`, `CardFooter`
- Maintains design system coherence

**3. CMSLink Enhancement**

- All link fields in new blocks leverage existing link or linkGroup fields and `CMSLink` component
- Material Design icons already integrated

- Consistent image/video handling and optimization
- Built-in responsive behavior

**5. Form Components**

- Contact forms in blocks use existing `Input`, `Textarea`, `Select` components
- Consistent form styling and validation

#### New UI Components Needed

**1. Accordion Component**

```typescript

```

**2. Tabs Component**

```typescript
// src/components/ui/tabs.tsx

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Collection Relationships

```
Departments ←→ Staff (many-to-many)
Departments ←→ Academic Programs (one-to-many)
Departments ←→ Events (one-to-many, optional)
Academic Programs ←→ Mentor Universities (many-to-many, conditional)
Academic Programs ←→ School Calendar (many-to-many, optional)
Staff ←→ Academic Programs (program coordinators)
Staff ←→ Events (organizers, optional)
Events ←→ Departments (optional)
School Calendar ←→ Academic Programs (affected programs, optional)
School Calendar ←→ Departments (affected departments, optional)
```

### Block Integration

- All new blocks will integrate with existing RenderBlocks system
- Responsive design following current UI patterns
- Material Design icons for enhanced UX
- TypeScript support throughout

### Data Migration

- Seed data creation for initial content
- Import utilities for bulk staff and program data
- Validation and error handling

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

**Collections & Core Infrastructure**

1. Create Departments collection
2. Create Academic Programs collection
3. Create Mentor Universities collection
4. Create Staff collection
5. Create Events collection
6. Create School Calendar collection
7. Set up relationships and validation

**New UI Components** 8. Create Accordion component (`src/components/ui/accordion.tsx`) 9. Create Tabs component (`src/components/ui/tabs.tsx`) 10. Create Badge component (`src/components/ui/badge.tsx`) 11. Create Avatar component (`src/components/ui/avatar.tsx`) 12. Create Dialog/Modal component (`src/components/ui/dialog.tsx`)

### Phase 2: Content Blocks (Weeks 3-5)

**Week 3: Academic-Specific Blocks**

1. academicPrograms Block
2. departmentOverview Block
3. universityOrganigram Block
4. mentorUniversities Block
5. eventsCalendar Block
6. academicCalendar Block

**Week 4: Essential Modern UI Blocks** 7. enhancedContent Block (enhanced version of current Content block) 8. accordion Block 9. tabs Block 10. testimonials Block 11. statistics Block 12. featureGrid Block

**Week 5: Advanced UI Blocks** 13. imageGallery Block 14. videoEmbed Block 15. socialProof Block 16. pricingTable Block

### Phase 3: Integration & Enhancement (Week 6)

**Content Management Improvements**

1. Update RenderBlocks component to include all new blocks
2. Create comprehensive seed data for all new blocks
3. Update TypeScript types and payload-types

**User Experience Enhancements** 4. Navigation updates with new content capabilities 5. Admin interface improvements for new blocks 6. Mobile responsiveness testing and optimization

**Quality Assurance** 7. Cross-browser testing for all new components 8. Accessibility audit and improvements 9. Performance optimization and bundle analysis 10. Documentation updates and usage examples

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Staff as Separate Collection**: Staff will be completely independent from Users collection to allow for public profiles and detailed academic information

2. **Conditional Mentor Universities**: Only Masters and PhD programs will have mentor university relationships

3. **Flexible Program Types**: Support for all program types with type-specific fields and validation

4. **Hierarchical Staff Structure**: Clear organizational hierarchy for organigram visualization

5. **Department-Centric Organization**: All academic content organized around departments

## Success Metrics

- Complete university structure representation
- Intuitive content management for administrators
- Public-facing staff directory and organigram
- Comprehensive program information display
- Partnership transparency through mentor university showcase
- Mobile-responsive design
- SEO optimization for all content types

## Next Steps

Once this documentation is approved, development will begin with Phase 1 collections, starting with the Departments collection as the foundation for the entire academic structure.
